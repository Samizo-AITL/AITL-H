# ðŸ§  AITL Logic Templates (Verilog Modules)

This directory provides reusable Verilog modules for FSM, PID, and LLM-based control structures,  
representing the theoretical "core logic" of the AITL architecture.

## Included Modules
- `fsm_core.v`: Basic Moore-style FSM logic
- `pid_controller.v`: Discrete PID controller (integer-based)
- `llm_interface_stub.v`: Placeholder for LLM-assisted instruction input
- `aitl_top.v`: Example integration of all modules

These templates are provided as a **structure-level reference**,  
not tied to any specific hardware implementation.
