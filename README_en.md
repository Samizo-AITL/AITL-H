# 🤖 AITL-H: Hybrid Structured Control Framework

**AITL-H (All-in-Theory Logic - Hybrid)** is a hierarchical intelligent control architecture designed for humanoid robots and adaptive systems.  
It integrates three layers: **FSM (Instinct) × PID (Reason) × LLM (Intelligence)** to achieve control with **responsiveness, stability, and flexibility**.

## 🧭 Overview

| Item        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Name**    | AITL-H (Hybrid) |
| **Purpose** | Establish intelligent control methods for humanoid systems |
| **Core Logic** | - FSM: Instinctive behavior control via state transitions<br>- PID: Continuous control of physical quantities (angles, speed)<br>- LLM: Intelligent judgment, conversation, and adaptation |

## 🧘 Three-Layer Architecture

| Layer   | Function                         | Implementation Example                    |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| FSM     | Logic control via state machines | `fsm_engine.py`, `fsm_state_def.yaml`     |
| PID     | Physical control (joints, motion) | `pid_controller.py`, `pid_module.py`     |
| LLM     | Judgment, anomaly detection, language interaction | `llm_interface.py`, `llm_logger.py` |

> Each layer is **loosely coupled yet coordinated**, allowing independent development and gradual integration.

## 🧪 Example: 3-Axis Gimbal Control with FSM × PID × LLM (AITL-HX)

> Proof-of-concept for gimbal control using the **AITL-HX architecture**.  
> Natural language command → FSM transition → PID stabilization → Actuator output.

| Component     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| LLM Layer     | Goal generation and intent recognition from natural language |
| FSM Layer     | State transitions (idle, follow, recovery) |
| PID Layer     | PID control of roll, pitch, yaw |
| Sensor Layer  | 3-axis IMU model for attitude estimation |
| Actuator Layer| Motor output control via PWM (simulated) |

🧭 Key Learning Points:
- Full-stack design of hybrid FSM + PID + LLM control
- Translating natural language into control objectives
- Implementing closed-loop intelligent control with MIMO and state coordination
