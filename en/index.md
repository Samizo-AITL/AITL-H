**AITL-H (All-in-Theory Logic - Hybrid)** is a **hierarchical intelligent control architecture** designed for humanoid robots and adaptive systems.  
With its three-layer structure of **FSM (instinct) × PID (reason) × LLM (intelligence)**, it combines **instant responsiveness, stability, and flexibility**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Name** | **AITL-H (Hybrid)** |
| **Purpose** | **Establishing a humanoid robot control methodology using structured AI control** |
| **Core Principles** | - **FSM**: instinctive behavioral control through state transitions<br>- **PID**: continuous control of physical quantities (angle, velocity)<br>- **LLM**: intelligent decision-making, dialogue, and learning |

---

## 🧘 Three-Layer Architecture

| Layer | Function | Example Implementation |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **FSM Layer** | Logic control based on state transitions | `fsm_engine.py`, `fsm_state_def.yaml` |
| **PID Layer** | Physical control of joints and movement | `pid_controller.py`, `pid_module.py` |
| **LLM Layer** | Situation judgment, anomaly detection, language response | `llm_interface.py`, `llm_logger.py` |

> Each layer is designed to be **loosely coupled yet collaborative**, enabling **independent development and phased integration**.

## 🌏 Strategic Significance

AITL-H is not just a control architecture —  
it integrates **state feedback control** and **state transition control**, combined with **LLM (Large Language Models)** and **SystemDK**,  
to enable **real-time, physically-constrained optimal design**.

- **Industrial Impact**  
  - Major reduction in fault recovery time (PoC evaluation: 94% reduction)  
  - 8× faster production line reconfiguration  
  - 40% reduction in design change costs  
- **National Importance**  
  - Securing competitiveness in advanced-node semiconductors and industrial autonomous systems  
  - Leadership in international standardization  

> **This technology must be integrated now.**  
> SystemDK is not unique to AITL-H — it is **a core technology required for all advanced-node semiconductor design**.
